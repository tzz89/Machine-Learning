Maximum Likelihood is about fitting a distribution to the data.Distributions are more general and easier to work with.

1. Cross Entropy (Negative log likelihood for classification task)

2. KL-Divergence
3. RMSE/MSE 
   1. When we use this for regression task, we are assuming that the continuous distribution variable is normally distributed
